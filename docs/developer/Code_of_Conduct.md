# OADP Team Code of Conduct

## Introduction

The guidelines here should be clear, easy to understand, and easy to follow.

### Assume positive intent, and bring a positive attitude and intentions.

First and foremost, assume positive intent. We are all working towards the same goal, and we are all part of the same team. We should bring a positive attitude and intentions to our work.  This work can be fun and challenging, and we should enjoy the journey.

### Respect peoples time and effort.

If someone takes the time to review your PR or contributes to your issue please understand
those comments took time and effort. Respect that time and effort and respond to it with
respect.


### Pull Request guidelines
1. Follow the PR template instructions. 
1. Avoid self overrides. If prow tests are failing, ask the reviewers to override tests if needed. 
1. Understand that communication is quite difficult. 
   - Do your best to over explain a comment.
   - Be patient and understanding.
1. The best reviews include suggestions, clarifications and when testing a PR post results to the PR.

### Issue guidelines
1. OADP released product issues and tasks are best written up in Jira not GitHub.
1. Openshift / Migtools org issues are best for unreleased features and tasks. next $x or $y release x.y.z.  

### Focus
We have limited time and resources. Choices have to be made with regards to how to best use those resources for the benefit of our customers.  PR's and issues that do not align with the project goals will be tagged with either:
- label:priority/awaiting-more-evidence
- label:priority/backlog
- label:priority/important-soon
- label:priority/important-longterm

The team should triage the above issues every 3 to 6 months. Do not expect reviews or comments on issues or PRs with the above labels.
